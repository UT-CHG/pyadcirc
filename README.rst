PyADCIRC is a python package of useful ADCIRC utilities for dealing with ADCIRC inputs/outputs, running ADCIRC simulations and more.

Description
===========

Current main areas of pyadcirc are:

        1. io - IO module provides functions for reading inputs and outputs
        2. viz - Viz module provides functions for visualization inputs and outputs, using a variety of figure generation software.
        3. data - The data module provides functions for dealing with data streams from other sources for ADCIRC simulations and verification.
        4. sim - Simulation utilities, for running ADCIRC simulations on HPC resources and locally.
        5. scripts - Useful scripts for ADCIRC.


Documentation is still a work in progress. See the notebooks directory for examples on how to use the variety of features provided by this package.
