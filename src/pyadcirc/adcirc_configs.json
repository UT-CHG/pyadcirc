It is assumed that the line in the Single File Meteorological Forcing Input File with a zero as the forecast increment (i.e., column 6) corresponds to the start of the current simulation run, whether it is a hotstart or cold start. In other words, there is no option to set the NWS value negative to indicate that the file starts at the ADCIRC hotstart time. Rather, the forecast increment in hours (column 6) is used to indicate the relationship between the ADCIRC time and the data in the fort.22 file. Wind velocity and atmospheric pressure are calculated at exact finite element mesh node locations and directly coupled to ADCIRC at every time step using the asymmetric hurricane vortex formulation (Mattocks et al, 2006; Mattocks and Forbes, 2008) based on the Holland gradient wind model. The input file is assumed to correspond to the ATCF Best Track/Objective Aid/Wind Radii Format. Historical tracks, real-time hindcast tracks and real-time forecast tracks may be found in this format. This option uses the radii at specific wind speeds (34, 50, 64, 100 knots) reported in the four quadrants (NE, SE, SW, NW) of the storm to calculate the radius of maximum winds as a function of the azimuthal angle. Garret\u2019s formula is used to compute wind stress from the wind velocity. The NWS=19 option allows the user to set a value for Rmax and Holland B Parameter. Additionally the user can select the isotachs to be used for each of the 4 quadrants.

There is no -19 option to indicate that the hours in column 6 are relative to the hotstart time. For the dynamic asymmetric model (NWS=19), ADCIRC always assumes that hour 0 corresponds to when the model is started, whether that is a cold start or a hot start. Therefore, ADCIRC analysts should not attempt to set NWS to -19. The original data in that column depends on what type of best track format data is being used.

The nodecode.63 output file is produced in ASCII format with the same structure as the fort.63 file (with the exception that the node code value is an integer) and on the same schedule as the fort.63 file. A nodal value of 1 in the nodecode.63 file indicates that the node is wet on the timestep that the data set was written, while a value of 0 indicates that the node is dry on the timestep that the data set was written. In order to be included in the computations of water surface elevation and velocity, a node must be wet.",

The noff.100 output file is produced in ASCII format with a structure similar to the fort.63 file, with the following exceptions: (a) the noff value is an integer; and (b) the noff array is elementally based, so the number of values for each time snap is equal to the number of elements, rather than the number of nodes. When outputNOFF is set to .true., the noff.100 file will be produced on the same schedule as the fort.63 file. An elemental value of 1 in the noff.100 file indicates that the element is wet on the timestep that the data set was written, while a value of 0 indicates that the element is dry on the timestep that the data set was written. In order to be included in the computations of water surface elevation and velocity, an element and all three of its nodes must be wet.",

Due to the sparse nature of the weir height output data, sparse ASCII format (nout_TVW=4) is recommended. If use_TVW is set to .true. but this parameter nout_TVW is not set at all, then nout_TVW is set to the same value as the file format specifier for the fort.63 file (NOUTGE). The data stored in the fort.77 file represent the change in the weir height (in meters, positive upward) compared to the weir height specified in the ADCIRC mesh file, rather than the absolute height of the weir at a particular time.",
